## How was this made?
I used HTML, CSS, and JS to create this mindfulness-based website in the course of 3 days. This website includes weekly guided meditation videos, a lofi and binural beats radio using Spotify embeds, a meditation timer, a quote generator, a collection of material about meditation and mindfulness, and a small mindfulness-based blog ran by me. Each part of the website was divided into sections based on the section's function and elements. 

As a note, the end of the CSS code consists of a heap of changes of text color, where the text color of dozens of divs and text to a very dark grey purely for visual improvement and better contrast.

## Test It Out
I am hosting this website via Replit and their services, thus the entire website can be accessed through the replit link below. HTML, CSS, and JS code is also attached within this repository otherwise.

## Future Plans
Given that this website was made for a hackathon, it's unlikely that this website will be updated further unless the website attains legitimate traffic.
